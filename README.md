# Track-My-Employee
An application that will track employees and managers in a specific department and allow the user to update employees 

When the application is launched it will prompt the user with a list of options to use in the application.

When "View all departments", "View all roles", and "View all employees" is selected they will show the current list of the respective databases in the code.

When any of the options that say "Add" is selected it will then prompt the user to input a name/department/role.

If it is a department it will then add that new department into the database and table that is shown in the command prompt.

If Role is selected to add it will then ask for a salary of the role and after that is successfully asnswered it will ask what department it belongs to. After those prompts have been answered the information that was added will be added to a new database and inserted into the table for roles.

If Employee is added after asking for first and last name it will prompt the user for their role. After the role has been selected it will ask who the manager of said employee is. When all prompts are answered the information will be added to a database and presented in a table.

When "Delete" is selected from the list originally prompted when starting it will remove any of the information that was entered in any of the tables and delete them from the tables.

Sorry I am not yet able to add a video demo of this as of right now I am working on a new computer that does not have the software yet!
